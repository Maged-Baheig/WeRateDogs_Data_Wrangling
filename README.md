# WeRateDogs_Data_Wrangling
“Valuable insights comes from hard wrangling” Throughout this report we will review the back scene circumstances, steps, actions,

Using Python, Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, requests, and tweepy libraries, via Jupyter Notebook,
We will Gather, Assess, Clean, and Augment the data to get valuable insights and conclusion.
